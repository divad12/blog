Hello world!

This is my first blog post.

I had originally planned to write my own blog engine in Haskell, so that I could have a project through which to deeply learn a functional language and to get some practice with web development. However, I've noticed that the larger the task, the more I tend to put it off. So, I decided to just go with an existing framework and then transition to my own blog engine, should I find it worthwhile. Recently, I found out about [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/), and it fit my original design requirements very well:
- Simple to set up
- Store blog posts as static text files
- Write and edit blog posts with my editor of choice (\[gm\]vim)
- Markdown formatting
- Publish and store blog posts on GitHub

Next I need to integrate Disqus for comments, tweak the CSS a little bit, and test on IE.

In other news, I'll be starting my internship at the [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/) in two days. This is really a dream internship for me&mdash;working on something I'm deeply passionate about with a [small, world-class team](http://www.khanacademy.org/about/the-team) that will hopefully revolutionize the education industry. Can't wait to start!
