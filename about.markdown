# {{ page.title }}

Hi, I'm David, a human being currently living on Earth.

More precisely, I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I've interned twice at Khan Academy, twice at Google, and twice at Sift Science (a machine learning startup).

I make things like [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com) and [UW Flow](https://uwflow.com).
